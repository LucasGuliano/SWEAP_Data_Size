Run_SWEAP_Get_Data is a set a scripts used to determine how much data was taken for each PSP orbit. 

The script will first search for the dates of each orbit and save the search results to the RAT_List.txt file. 
 
It will use that date that was allocated to PSP during each orbit. 

SWEAP_Data_Size.py will then determine how much data was actually used during that time period.
